This is Minesweeper repository


The style.css is a custom file that I use in my projects to reset css.

I started with the sass, js and css files structure, then I started to develop the app.

At the time of developing the game I based a tutorial but I made my own modifications

Then I started adding the css styles to the app and preparing the assets and images that I used.
